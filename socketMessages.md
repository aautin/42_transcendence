## Communication Flow

1. **Connection & Initialization**:
   - Client connects to `/game/{gameId}`
   - Server sends `playerNumber`, `connected`, initial `gameState`, and `settingsUpdate`

2. **Lobby & Setup**:
   - Clients send `playerReady`
   - Server notifies Player 1 with `player2Ready` when Player 2 is ready
   - Player 1 sends `startGameRequest`
   - Server responds with `gameStart` to both players

3. **Gameplay**:
   - Server sends periodic `gameState` updates (60fps when active, 1/5th that rate when idle)
   - Clients send `movePaddle` when moving
   - Serving player sends `startGame` to begin after scoring
   - Server broadcasts updated `gameState`

4. **Game End/Disconnect**:
   - Client sends `playerDisconnect` or connection closes
   - Server sends `gameOver` to remaining player

This message protocol enables the complete pong game functionality including lobby management, paddle movement, scoring, and game state synchronization.
